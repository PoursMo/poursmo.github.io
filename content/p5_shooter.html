<p>
	After making some very small projects on
	<a target="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5.js Web Editor</a> to learn JavaScript, I
	started making a game using this same library.<br />
	The game is a shoot 'em up with difficulty increasing over time. At 5 minutes, the boss spawns and
	defeating it rewards the player with victory.<br />
	The p5 library has very basic features, so I had to code most functions myself - like collision
	detection or sprite splicing - which was challenging and fun.

	I uploaded the game on itch.io if you want to try it out:<br />
